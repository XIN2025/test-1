This section is designed as a supportive toolkit, not a prescription: these supplement strategies are based on patterns seen in your biomarkers and symptoms, and grounded in the science of functional and lifestyle medicine. The focus is always synergy—matching the right nutrients to your body’s needs, and weaving these options into your broader lifestyle, from food and movement to rest and connection.\n\nEvery supplement here is chosen to support a specific “system” in your body (think: energy, detox, inflammation, brain, gut). They’re meant to help nudge your biology back toward balance, especially when paired with positive daily habits. Please use this as a conversation starter with your healthcare provider. Supplements work best when integrated with healthy food, restorative sleep, movement, and strong social ties—not as a stand-alone fix. Your wellness plan is always more powerful when you’re an active participant.\n\nSupplement Plan Table\nSupplement        Dose        Biomarker Trigger        Duration        Cycling Note\nCoQ10        100 mg/day        Low HRV, fatigue, or statin use        8 weeks        Use daily, reassess at 2 mo\nOmega-3 (EPA/DHA)        1 g/day (split)        High CRP, lipid imbalance        Ongoing        Take with meals, ongoing\nMagnesium Glycinate        200–300 mg/day        Tension, poor sleep, cramps        6–12 weeks        Use nightly, reassess\nNAC (N-acetylcysteine)        600 mg 2x/day        Elevated liver enzymes, detox needs        8 weeks        2 months on, 1 month off\nVitamin D3        2000 IU/day (adjust for labs)        Low 25(OH)D        12 weeks        Recheck levels, adjust seasonally\nProbiotic (Lacto/Bifido blend)        Clinician guided        GI issues, recent antibiotic use        4–8 weeks        Cycle, alternate strains\n\nHow to use this table:\n\nCoQ10 can help support cellular energy and heart function, especially if you have low heart rate variability or take statins.\n\nOmega-3s are anti-inflammatory and great for metabolic health.\n\nMagnesium is calming for mind and muscle; many people are low, especially under stress.\n\nNAC supports detoxification and the body’s antioxidant systems—useful if your labs show oxidative stress or sluggish detox pathways.\n\nVitamin D3 is a foundation for immune and bone health; check your blood levels after 12 weeks to find your sweet spot.\n\nProbiotics help replenish gut flora after stress or antibiotics; use for several weeks, then take a break or rotate with different blends.\n\nSynergy with daily behaviors:\n\nPair supplements with nutrient-dense meals (lots of veggies, healthy fats, whole grains), regular physical activity, and restorative sleep routines.\n\nEngage with your social network—connection is a proven longevity factor, just like in the world’s “blue zones.”\n\nPractice mindfulness or gentle stress reduction daily to help your biology use these nutrients most effectively.\n\nRemember, these are options to explore with your practitioner—your feedback and preferences matter!
