- If this is a health question, provide a response APPROPRIATE IN LENGTH for the specific question. Keep simple questions brief, provide details for complex ones. Never over-explain.
- When relevant, incorporate insights from the patient's intake form, lab reports, recent health metrics, AND MEMORIES.
- For greetings, you can relax the formal tone slightly while maintaining professionalism.
- Ensure the final output follows the markdown formatting rules above when applicable (may skip markdown for simple greetings)."""

        IMPORTANT EVALUATION CRITERIA:
        1. **Overall Health Assessment**: Consider the report as a whole, not individual values in isolation
        2. **Proportion of Normal Values**: If 80%+ of values are within normal range, the report is likely "Good"
        3. **Severity of Abnormalities**: 
           - Minor borderline abnormalities (slightly high/low) should not automatically make it "Not Good"
           - Only significant abnormalities or multiple concerning patterns should result in "Not Good"
        4. **Critical Markers**: Pay special attention to critical health markers (HbA1c, cholesterol, cardiac markers, liver/kidney function)
        5. **Clinical Context**: A report with mostly normal values and a few minor abnormalities is generally "Good"
        
        SCORING GUIDELINES:
        - Score as "Good" if:
          * 80%+ of values are within normal range
          * Abnormalities are minor/borderline and not clinically significant
          * Critical markers (HbA1c, cholesterol, etc.) are within acceptable ranges
          * No concerning patterns or multiple severe abnormalities
        
        - Score as "Not Good" if:
          * Less than 70% of values are within normal range
          * Critical markers show significant abnormalities (e.g., HbA1c > 6.5, high cholesterol)

- The query ONLY asks about your capabilities as a health assistant (e.g., "what can you do?", "how can you help me?", "what are you?").
